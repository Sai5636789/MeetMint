# Sprint 3 Deliverables & Documentation - Final Submission

## 1. Work Completed in Sprint 3

Sprint 3 focused on moving from a Minimum Viable Product to a production-ready meeting intelligence platform. The team successfully integrated commercial-grade AI and implemented advanced data management features.

- **Google Gemini Pro Integration**: Successfully transitioned from the local Python ML server to the Google Gemini Pro API for transcription analysis. This significantly improved the quality of meeting summaries and the accuracy of extracted action items.
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Designed and implemented a RAG pipeline in the Go backend. Meeting transcripts are now chunked, embedded, and stored, allowing for intelligent searching and context-aware Q&A within the dashboard.
- **Advanced Task Persistence & Management**: Fixed critical data persistence issues where tasks would disappear on reload. Refactored the database scanning layer to handle nullable fields and optimized the React state management for optimistic UI updates.
- **Interactive Team Control**: Added comprehensive team management tools, including:
    - **Interactive Member Tooltips**: Real-time presence and role information.
    - **Member Removal**: Ability to manage project scope by removing team members directly from the UI.
    - **Intelligent Assignment**: Automatic member addition to projects when a task is assigned to a teammate outside the current project circle.
- **Robustness & Error Handling**: Implemented graceful fallbacks for API failures and improved backend validation logic to ensure database integrity.

## 2. Frontend Test Coverage (Sprint 3)

For Sprint 3, we expanded our test suite to cover the new processing flows and component interactions.

### Unit & Component Tests
- `ProcessingScreen.test.jsx`:
    - `displays upload progress`: Verifies the status bar updates correctly during the multipart file upload.
    - `handles cancellation`: Ensures cleanup logic runs if a user cancels an in-progress analysis.
- `RegisterPage.test.jsx`:
    - `validates password strength`: Ensures minimum security requirements are met on the client side.
    - `matches passwords`: Confirms password and confirmation fields are synchronized.
- `Sprint3.test.jsx`:
    - `verifies RAG search bar`: Tests the new intelligent search input for meeting transcripts.
    - `checks task owner lookup`: Validates that the UI correctly maps user IDs to names from the global directory.
- `App.test.jsx` & `Dashboard.test.jsx`: Maintained existing coverage for core routing and data fetching.

## 3. Backend Test Coverage (Golang)

The backend test suite was significantly expanded to cover the RAG logic and the Gemini API bridge.

- **AI & RAG Tests**:
    - `gemini_test.go`: `TestGeminiSummary_Success` validates the integration with Google's API.
    - `rag_test.go`: `TestInsertRAGChunk`, `TestGetRAGChunksByProject`, and `TestCosineSimilarity` (verifying the vector search mathematical logic).
- **Update Handlers**:
    - `handlers_test.go`: Expanded to include `TestHandler_DeleteTask`, `TestHandler_RemoveMember`, and `TestHandler_CreateTaskSync`.
- **OTP & Security**:
    - `otp_sprint3_test.go`: `TestUpsertPendingSignup_UpdatesOnConflict` ensures the registration flow handles multiple attempts for the same email correctly.
- **Core Persistence**:
    - `queries_test.go`: Updated with robust tests for the new nullable database scanning logic.

## 4. Updated Backend API Documentation

The MeetMint API has been extended to support more granular task control and specialized job status tracking.

### New & Updated Endpoints

#### `GET /api/project-details` (Updated)
Now returns a more comprehensive payload including full member objects and detailed task status history.
- **Response:** `{ "meetings": [...], "tasks": [...], "members": [...] }`

#### `POST /api/tasks/create`
Manually create a task for a project without needing an AI analysis.
- **Body:** `{ "project_id": "...", "title": "...", "owner_id": "..." }`

#### `POST /api/projects/members/remove`
Removes a user's access to a specific project.
- **Body:** `{ "project_id": "...", "user_id": "..." }`

#### `GET /api/jobs/status`
A new utility endpoint to track the background progress of Gemini processing or video uploads.
- **Query:** `?job_id={uuid}`
- **Response:** `{ "status": "processing", "progress": 45, "message": "Analyzing transcript..." }`

#### `POST /api/ask`
The entry point for the RAG pipeline. Answers questions about a project's meeting history.
- **Body:** `{ "project_id": "...", "question": "..." }`
- **Response:** `{ "answer": "...", "citation": "..." }`
