## 1. Work Completed in Sprint 4

Sprint 4 focused on system hardening, advanced AI integration, and enriching the user experience with multimedia and personalization features. This sprint successfully brought the MeetMint platform to a production-ready state.

- **AI Model Upgrade**: Migrated the core intelligence layer to **Gemini 1.5 Flash**. This update significantly reduced processing latency and improved the logical consistency of generated meeting summaries and task extractions.
- **Header-Based Authentication**: Enhanced security by refactoring the AI bridge to use header-based authentication for Google Gemini API calls, moving away from query-param based keys for better logging safety and security.
- **Multimedia Image Storage**: Implemented a SQLite BLOB-based image storage system. Users can now attach whiteboard photos and screenshots directly to meeting records via the new `/api/images/upload` endpoint.
- **Granular Task Metadata**: Extended the task management system to support manual updates of due dates and project owners, ensuring full control over the AI-generated project plans.
- **Manual Transcript Refinement**: Added support for manual transcript corrections. Users can now edit AI-generated transcripts to ensure 100% accuracy, with updates automatically propagating to the RAG vector search engine.
- **Interactive Theme Engine**: (Frontend) Developed a gesture-based theme switcher in the dashboard, allowing users to dynamically switch between Blue, Red, Purple, and Emerald color palettes with real-time CSS variable updates.
- **Dynamic Identification**: Integrated the UI-Avatars API to provide personalized user profile icons throughout the platform, improving team recognition in headers and task lists.

## 2. Frontend Test Coverage (Sprint 4)

The Sprint 4 test suite focused on verifying the integration of new personalization features and metadata-driven UI components.

### Feature & Integration Tests
- `Sprint4.test.jsx`:
    - `renders the Dynamic User Avatar`: Verifies that the UI-Avatars API is correctly integrated and generates personalized icons based on user names.
    - `shows the Task Due Date`: Validates that the frontend correctly fetches and displays the new `due_date` metadata from the backend.
    - `opens the Task Edit modal`: Ensures the task modification UI provides a functional date picker and assignee selection interface.
- `Dashboard.test.jsx`: Updated to verify the persistence of theme selections across navigation cycles.
- `ProcessingScreen.test.jsx`: Verified that the new Gemini 1.5 Flash status messages are correctly parsed and displayed.

## 3. Backend Test Coverage (Golang)

Backend testing for Sprint 4 was expanded to cover the new binary data handling and security refactors.

- **Security & AI Tests**:
    - `gemini_test.go`: Updated to verify that API keys are sent via headers rather than URLs.
    - `rag_test.go`: `TestUpdateMeetingTranscript` ensures that manual transcript edits successfully re-trigger chunking and embedding updates.
- **Multimedia Tests**:
    - `handlers_test.go`: Added `TestHandler_UploadImage` and `TestHandler_GetImage` to verify binary BLOB storage and retrieval from SQLite.
- **Metadata Management**:
    - `queries_test.go`: Added tests for `UpdateTaskDetail`, verifying that due dates and owner IDs are correctly persisted.
- **Stability**:
    - Maintained a suite of **35+ passing tests** covering the entire API surface area.

## 4. Updated Backend API Documentation

The MeetMint API has been further refined to support multimedia attachments and granular data corrections.

### New & Updated Endpoints

#### `GET /api/images/:id` (New)
Retrieve raw image data stored in the database.
- **Response:** Binary stream with appropriate `Content-Type` header (e.g., `image/png`).

#### `POST /api/tasks/update-detail` (New)
Update specific metadata for an existing task.
- **Body:** `{ "task_id": "...", "title": "...", "due_date": "...", "owner_id": "..." }`
